## FAQ

#### Is this how you code in all your apps?

No. This is just meant to pass all the tests in codewars. This **doesn't** demonstrate my actual coding standard.

#### Can I participate in this too?

Yes, of course! Jump over to the [website](https://www.codewars.com) and code away. Don't forget share your progress on Twiter and tag me on [there](https://twitter.com/sumitsaurabh927) .
